# Exercism bash track

The primary intent of this repo is to record my learning of bash using exercism.io. First goal is to give a valid solution, however I want to go about it or however feel natural to me. Then, to give a solution that is considered best practices in bash. Any optimizations I find to my own solutions or other interesting ways I want to try to solve them are fine after this point, it's the journey not the destination that matters here.

# Exercism bash Testing

To execute the tests, use bats.

```bash
bats test.sh
```
